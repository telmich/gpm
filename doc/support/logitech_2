Thank you for using Logitech's Electronic Technical Support. My name is Peggy. The following information addresses your original question. You may wish to print this out and/or save this on your computer.

Following is all the information I was able to find on Linux and Logitech mice.  I hope it will help you some.

At this time, LINUX is not a supported operating system for Logitech pointing devices. Do not use the software which comes with the Logitech mouse. 
Linux has Logitech drivers built in. Run either Linuxconf (for shell use) or XF86Config and tell it you're using a Logitech mouse. There are specific entries for serial, bus, and PS2 mice. Currently, the kernel does not support USB mice. 
As a demand for this operating system increases, Logitech will consider implementing support for it in the future. Please visit our web site periodically for information on product announcements and releases. 
Configuring 3 button support in Linux (X-Free): 
In LINUX, you normally have only 2 button support, but it is possible to emulate a third button by pressing the left and the right button together (chording). This is a very uncomfortable solution. So, if a customer is asking for a nice solution, tell him following: 
Edit the file: /usr/lib/X11/Xconfig 
and try the following: 
MouseMan "/dev/mouse" 
Emulate3buttons 
and then you have 3-button-support in LINUX 
Configuring 3 button support in Linux ver.1.1.59: 
The following information was entered in the configuration file for X11R6 found in the directory: /USR/X11R6/LIB/X11 
In this directory the user will find a config file called: XF86CONFIG 
They need to change, or make sure the information in the "POINTER" section reads as follows: 
Section "Pointer" 
Protocol "MouseMan" 
Device "/DEV/MOUSE" 
EndSection 
PROTOCOL specifies the mouse protocol that your mouse uses (not the make or brand of mouse). Valid types for PROTOCOL are: 
BusMouse, Logitech, Microsoft, MMSeries, MouseMan, MouseSystems, PS/2 & MMHitTab 
DEVICE specifies the device file where the mouse can be accessed. On most Linux systems, this is /DEV/MOUSE. /DEV/MOUSE is usually a link to the appropriate serial port (such as /DEV/CUA0) for serial mice, or the appropriate BusMouse device for BusMice. Just be sure the device file listed in DEVICE exists. 
BaudRate and SampleRate are only for some Logitech mice. An example of these, which would be added under DEVICE line are: 
BaudRate 9600 
SampleRate 150

Hello Jesse!

It would be nice for many logitech users to get mouse devices from
logitech to work under Linux.

When you start sharing information or supporting Linux, please drop me
a line, so I can include the support into gpm and possibly later into X.

Just one more question, why don't you release those information ?
What's the problem when the information are public available ?

Thanks in advance,

Nico Schottelius
