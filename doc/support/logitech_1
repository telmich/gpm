Hello!

I am the Linux gpm mouse maintainer and I would like to include
some more mouses from logitech into the support.
Gpm is the primary Linux mouse driver. For more information about
gpm visit freshmeat.net and search gpm.

I only need some protocol specifications and possibly other informations
from you.

Do you think we can corporate ?

Thanks for you answer,

Nico Schottelius
