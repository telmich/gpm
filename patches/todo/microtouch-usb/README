Subject: gpm and usb touchscreen

 My name is Radoslaw Garbacz.
I have added support to MicroTouch usb devices in gpm application. I
send You the patch and the source of mice.c (which I changed).
 Please send me any suggestions about it.
 If You think that is is good idea to join my changes to official
release of gpm I'll be very glad.
I also send You source of microtouch device driver to check my changes.

It is also nessesary to copy touchscreen.h file to ./include/linux
directory.

I changed the gpm, version 1.19.1.

Best reagrds.
