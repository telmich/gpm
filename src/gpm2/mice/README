This directory should contain the mice-protocol implementations.

Each file (or if bigger: directory) implements one protocol.

You have to create three functions:

   gpm2_open_<protocol>();
   gpm2_handle_<protocol>();
   gpm2_close_<protocol>();

It's not yet clear, how to register protocols to gpm2.

First idea of inclusion:

- create deps/mouse-<protocol> containging all dependencies
- conf/built-options/mice specifies which mice protocols to include
- a script generates include/gpm2-daemon-mice.h containg a struct-array
  that looks like:

   struct mice_protos {
      char *name;
      int (*open)();
      int (*handle)();
      int (*open)();
   };
