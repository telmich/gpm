The files in this directory should built up the client interface.

Some ideas:

   struct gpm2_conn *gpm2_connect():
      client connects to gpm2-daemon

   gpm2_get_mice(struct gpm2_conn  *g2c):
      get list of devices, including protocols and ids

   struct *mouseinfo gpm2_open_mouse(int mouse_id, int type);
      returns set of descriptors:
         - to read mousedata

   int gpm2_close_mouse(struct *mouseinfo mi);
