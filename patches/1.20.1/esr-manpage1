This is automatically generated email about problems in a man page for which
you appear to be responsible.  If you are not the right person or list, tell
me and I will attempt to correct my database.

See http://catb.org/~esr/doclifter/problems.html for details on how and
why these patches were generated.  Feel free to email me with any questions.
Note: These patches do not change the mod date of any manual page.  You
may wish to do that by hand.

Problems with gpm-types.7:

My records indicate that you have accepted this patch, so this is just
a reminder.  Please try to get a release with the patch incorporated
to the Fedora folks in time for Fedora Core 4.

1. Missing or garbled name section.  The most common form of garbling
is a missing - or extra -. Or your manual page may have been generated
by a tool that doesn't emit a NAME section as it should.  These
problems make it impossible to lift the page to DocBook.  They
can also confuse some implementations of man -k.
