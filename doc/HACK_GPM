Hello!

Nice that you read this document, looks like someone wants to improve gpm again.
I assume you have a good idea or you did some good work you want to see in the
main gpm tree. To make life easy for you and me, please follow the instructions:

   * if you send a patch, explain why it's needed
   * if possible, please patch against latest cvs sources (see README)
   * if the patch introduces generally new things, explain how it works
   * use 3 spaces tabs in the source files (if you use tabs, look into
     contrib/scripts/replace_tab_with_3_spaces)
   * if the patch is not big, use one file
   * if you have to use more files, tar them
   * include directory structure (src/mice.c and not mice.c)
   * everything fine ? So send the patch.

Thanks for your help,

Nico
